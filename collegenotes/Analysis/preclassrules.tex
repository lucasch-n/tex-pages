\maketitle

Write notes on paper, then type up into LaTeX after class. You can also just not write that many notes, and that will make typing up later easier. 
Additionally, it's possible to type up notes in class in a not crazy-difficult way. 

For homework, work on a blackboard, take a picture, and then type the work up in LaTeX. This process will make doing math easier and allow for practice writing scientific papers.
